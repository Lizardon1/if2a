This file details conventions that have to be enforced within if2a so that working
on shared code can be achieved less painfully.

1. Headers
----------
Each C file has its corresponding header that gets the same name as the C file.
Each C file includes the headers it needs (and only these ones). 
No header inclusion is allowed within a header except when definitions _INSIDE_ 
the header need external includes.
In the list of includes, the header corresponding to the source file must be the 
first, then the others.

2. Documentation
----------------
Each function should be documented in its header so that it is easy to figure 
out what the function does without having to look at the source

3. Naming conventions (in the works)
------------------------------------
Filenames all get the f2a prefix.
Use appropriate prefixes for functions (e.g. f2au_ for Ultra functions). 
Notation should be : prefix_objectOfOperation_operation e.g f2au_CD_read for a 
function that operates on the Content Descriptor and reads its contents.

4. I/Os
-------
Prefer the use of functions that work on buffers. You can then translate these 
buffers to file or get buffers from files using the functions from f2autils.h

5. Comments
-----------
Multi-line comments should use the '/* */' as shown :
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 * Notice how each line starts with a star
 */
 
Single-line comment use the '//' convention :
// This is a single line comment
